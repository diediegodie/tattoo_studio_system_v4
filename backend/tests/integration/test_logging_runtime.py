"""
Integration test for runtime logging functionality.

This test validates that:
1. Log files are created properly
2. JSON format is used in log files
3. Required keys are present (timestamp, level, logger, message, context)
4. SQLAlchemy queries are logged
5. Flask request/response tracking works
