"""
Unit tests for Artist creation and selection functionality - SOLID compliant.

Tests cover:
- Domain entities validation
- Repository operations
- Service business logic
- Controller HTTP handling

Following SOLID testing principles:
- Single Responsibility: Each test validates one specific behavior
- Interface Segregation: Tests use interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Dependency Inversion: Mocks are injected through interfaces
