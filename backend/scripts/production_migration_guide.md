# 🚀 Production Migration Guide: Optional Client in Payments

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for safely applying the `cliente_id` nullable migration to your production PostgreSQL database.

## 📋 Pre-Migration Checklist

- [ ] Confirm application is in maintenance mode (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Verify database connection details
- [ ] Ensure sufficient disk space for backup
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready
- [ ] Test migration on staging environment first

## 1. 🛡️ Pre-Migration Safety - Database Backup

### Create Production Backup
```bash
# Replace with your actual database credentials
export DB_HOST="your-postgres-host"
export DB_USER="your-postgres-user"  
export DB_NAME="your-database-name"
export BACKUP_DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Create backup with custom format (recommended for large databases)
pg_dump -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -Fc $DB_NAME > backup_before_nullable_cliente_id_${BACKUP_DATE}.dump

# Alternative: Create SQL backup
pg_dump -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST $DB_NAME > backup_before_nullable_cliente_id_${BACKUP_DATE}.sql
```

### Verify Backup Integrity
```bash
# Test that backup can be read
pg_restore --list backup_before_nullable_cliente_id_${BACKUP_DATE}.dump | head -20

# Check backup file size
ls -lh backup_before_nullable_cliente_id_${BACKUP_DATE}.dump
```

## 2. 🔧 Apply Migration

### Option A: Using Our Migration Script
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/tattoo_studio_system_v4

# Set production database URL (adjust as needed)
export [REDACTED_DATABASE_URL]

# Run the migration script
python backend/scripts/migrate_cliente_id_nullable.py
```

### Option B: Manual SQL Execution
```sql
-- Connect to your production database
psql -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME

-- Execute the migration
BEGIN;

-- Make cliente_id nullable
ALTER TABLE pagamentos ALTER COLUMN cliente_id DROP NOT NULL;

-- Verify the change
SELECT column_name, is_nullable, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'pagamentos' AND column_name = 'cliente_id';

-- Commit only if verification looks correct
COMMIT;
```

## 3. ✅ Post-Migration Verification

### Schema Verification
```sql
-- Connect to database
psql -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME

-- Check pagamentos table structure
\d pagamentos;

-- Expected output should show cliente_id without NOT NULL constraint:
-- cliente_id | integer | | | 
```

### Functional Testing
```sql
-- Test 1: Insert payment without client
INSERT INTO pagamentos (valor, forma_pagamento, descricao, created_at, cliente_id)
VALUES (100.00, 'debito', 'Test payment without client', NOW(), NULL);

-- Verify insertion succeeded
SELECT id, valor, forma_pagamento, cliente_id, descricao 
FROM pagamentos 
WHERE descricao = 'Test payment without client';

-- Test 2: Insert payment with client (existing functionality)
INSERT INTO pagamentos (valor, forma_pagamento, descricao, created_at, cliente_id)
VALUES (150.00, 'credito', 'Test payment with client', NOW(), 1);

-- Clean up test data
DELETE FROM pagamentos WHERE descricao LIKE 'Test payment%';
```

### Application Testing
```bash
# Start your application and test:
# 1. Navigate to payment registration form
# 2. Try creating payment without selecting a client
# 3. Verify payment appears in Historico
# 4. Test search functionality includes payments without clients
```

## 4. 🔄 Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

### Quick Rollback via Backup Restore
```bash
# DANGER: This will completely restore database to pre-migration state
# All data created after backup will be lost!

# Option A: Restore from custom format backup
pg_restore -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME --clean --if-exists backup_before_nullable_cliente_id_${BACKUP_DATE}.dump

# Option B: Restore from SQL backup  
psql -U $DB_USER -h $DB_HOST -d $DB_NAME < backup_before_nullable_cliente_id_${BACKUP_DATE}.sql
```

### Surgical Rollback (Preserve New Data)
```sql
-- If you need to rollback but preserve data created after migration
-- This is more complex and depends on your specific situation

-- First, identify any payments created without clients
SELECT id, valor, forma_pagamento, created_at 
FROM pagamentos 
WHERE cliente_id IS NULL;

-- You may need to:
-- 1. Assign a default client to these payments, OR
-- 2. Delete these payments (if acceptable), OR
-- 3. Keep them and make cliente_id NOT NULL again (will fail if NULL values exist)

-- To make column NOT NULL again (only if no NULL values exist):
-- ALTER TABLE pagamentos ALTER COLUMN cliente_id SET NOT NULL;
```

## 5. 📊 Monitoring & Validation

### Post-Migration Checks
```sql
-- Count payments by client status
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN cliente_id IS NULL THEN 'Without Client'
        ELSE 'With Client'
    END as client_status,
    COUNT(*) as payment_count
FROM pagamentos 
GROUP BY (cliente_id IS NULL);

-- Verify search functionality works for payments without clients
-- (This should be tested via application interface)

-- Check for any foreign key constraint issues
SELECT conname, conrelid::regclass 
FROM pg_constraint 
WHERE conrelid = 'pagamentos'::regclass 
AND contype = 'f';
```

## 6. 🎯 Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] ✅ Migration script executed successfully without errors
- [ ] ✅ Database backup created and verified
- [ ] ✅ `cliente_id` column is now nullable in `pagamentos` table
- [ ] ✅ Can insert payments with `cliente_id = NULL`
- [ ] ✅ Existing payments with clients still work normally
- [ ] ✅ Application UI allows creating payments without clients
- [ ] ✅ Payments without clients appear correctly in Historico/Extrato
- [ ] ✅ Search functionality includes payments without clients
- [ ] ✅ No errors in application logs related to payment functionality

## 🚨 Emergency Contacts

If issues occur during migration:
1. **Immediately stop** the migration process
2. **Do not commit** any incomplete transactions
3. **Execute rollback plan** if necessary
4. **Check application logs** for specific error messages
5. **Contact development team** with detailed error information
